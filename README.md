### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aaron

I'm currently trying out different languages/frameworks on AWS Lambda for API development (check out my recent repos to see!). I'm mostly comfortable with python but currently also doing a fair bit of Rust and some TypeScript here and there. I also quite enjoy using Terraform with AWS.

Outside of programming, I love traveling, going for long hikes or enjoying some live music. I'm planning to move back to Copenhagen in May 2023 and very excited about that. I will also be on the lookout for a job during that time, so if you have a cool project or know someone don't hesitate to contact me! You can contact me through [aaron.visschedijk@gmail.com](mailto:aaron.visschedijk@gmail.com) or on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-visschedijk-03953a146/). You can also check out my [personal website](https://aaronvisschedijk.com).
 
##### I've also published some research on 3D printed interactables, you should totally [check it out!](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3490149.3501314)
