### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Aaron

Currently trying out different languages/frameworks on AWS Lambda for API development. Mostly comfortable with python but currently also doing a fair bit of Rust and some TypeScript here and there.
 
##### I've also published some research on 3D printed interactables, you should totally [check it out!](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3490149.3501314)
